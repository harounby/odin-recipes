    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Shakshuka (or shakshouka) is a traditional Tunisian dish featuring poached eggs in a spicy tomato sauce with onions, bell pepper, and garlic. It's usually eaten for breakfast, but I think it makes a tasty lunch or dinner, served with lots of bread to mop up the sauce.</p>
